#DEFAULT KEYBINDINGS from man page
#     tmux may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a prefix key, ‘C-b’
#     (Ctrl-b) by default, followed by a command key.
#
#     The default command key bindings are:
#
#           C-b         Send the prefix key (C-b) through to the application.
#           C-o         Rotate the panes in the current window forwards.
#           C-z         Suspend the tmux client.
#           !           Break the current pane out of the window.
#           "           Split the current pane into two, top and bottom.
